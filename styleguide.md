# ELLIOT REICH — Personal Brand Style Guide

---

## 01 — Identity

**Name**
ELLIOT REICH

This is the anchor of the identity. It should always appear in full. No nicknames, no abbreviations unless space constraints make them unavoidable (in which case: E. REICH).

**Voice**
Editorial. Intellectual. Direct. The writing is precise without being cold, curious without being academic. It does not perform warmth — it earns it through specificity.

---

## 02 — Color

The palette draws from natural, muted materials: aged paper, walnut, lichen. It is never stark or clinical. Even "neutral" here has warmth.

### Primary Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Parchment** | `#F5F0E8` | Background; stands in for white on all surfaces |
| **Bark** | `#4A3728` | Primary text; dark anchor; headers, body |
| **Lichen** | `#6B7A4A` | Accent; links, rules, highlight moments |

### Secondary Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Dusk** | `#8C7B6B` | Secondary text, captions, metadata |
| **Stone** | `#C9BFB2` | Borders, dividers, subtle UI elements |
| **Ink** | `#1F1A14` | Sparingly, for maximum contrast when needed |

### Usage Rules

- **Never use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or pure black (`#000000`).** Parchment is your white. Ink is your black.
- Lichen is the single pop of color — use it with restraint. One accent per composition.
- Backgrounds are always warm. If layering surfaces, step slightly darker or lighter within the Parchment–Stone range.
- Dark mode equivalent: swap Parchment for `#1F1A14` (Ink), text to `#F5F0E8` (Parchment), Lichen remains.

## 03 — Typography

The system pairs two clean sans-serifs: one geometric for identity and display, one humanist for body text. The combination reads modern but not cold.

### Typefaces

**Display / Identity: [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans)**
Used for: name lockup, headers, navigation, subject lines, stationery headings.
Weight in use: **Medium (500)** and **Light (300)**. Avoid Bold.

**Body: [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)**
Used for: paragraph text, email body, captions, running copy.
Weight in use: **Regular (400)**. Italics sparingly.

Both are free via Google Fonts and widely supported across web, email, and design tools.

### Type Scale (base 16px / 1rem)

| Level | Size | Weight | Tracking | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Name / Wordmark | 24–36px | DM Sans Medium | +0.15em | Letterhead, site header |
| H1 | 28px | DM Sans Light | +0.05em | Page titles |
| H2 | 20px | DM Sans Medium | 0 | Section headers |
| H3 | 16px | Inter Regular | 0 | Sub-headers |
| Body | 16px | Inter Regular | 0 | All running text |
| Caption / Meta | 13px | Inter Regular | +0.03em | Dates, labels, footnotes |

### Typography Rules

- Line height for body: **1.6**. Do not compress below 1.5.
- Never use italic for emphasis in headers — use weight or color instead.
- All-caps ELLIOT REICH in the wordmark only. Avoid all-caps elsewhere except for very short navigation labels.
- Minimum body text size: 14px. Never smaller.

## 04 — Layout & Space

The layout language is structured but not rigid. It favors generous whitespace, flush-left alignment, and a single strong axis.

### Principles

- **Flush left.** Text and elements align left. Centered text only for brief standalone moments (a pull quote, a section title on print collateral).
- **Generous margins.** On print: minimum 0.75 in. On screen: minimum 48px padding. Let content breathe.
- **One column by default.** Resist multi-column layouts unless there is a clear functional reason.
- **No decorative ornamentation.** No flourishes, borders, or frames. A single hairline rule (1px, in Stone or Lichen) is the only permissible divider.

### Grid

Web: 12-column grid, max content width 720px for reading, 960px for full layout.
Stationery: baseline grid of 14px. Margins: 0.875 in all sides.

## 05 — Applications

### Personal Website

- Background: Parchment `#F5F0E8`
- Nav: DM Sans Medium, 14px, tracked +0.1em, Bark text
- Name in header: DM Sans Medium, 28px+, Bark
- Links: Lichen `#6B7A4A`, no underline by default, underline on hover
- Avoid cards with heavy shadows — prefer a Stone border or no border at all
- Section dividers: 1px Stone rule, full-width

### Email Signature

```
ELLIOT REICH
—
[Title or descriptor, optional]
elliot@[domain] · [city]
[website URL]
```

Font: DM Sans or fallback to Helvetica Neue, Arial.
Color: Bark for name, Dusk for secondary lines.
No logos, no images, no social icons in the signature.
A single em dash (—) as separator between name and contact info.

### Stationery (Letterhead / Notecards)

- Paper stock: warm white or natural (e.g. Crane's Lettra, Mohawk Superfine Softwhite — not bright white)
- Name at top, flush left: DM Sans Medium, ~18pt
- Contact info: Inter Regular, 9–10pt, Dusk color or printed in a mid-warm gray
- No box borders around the letterhead block
- For notecards: name centered only if it functions as a monogram-like mark, otherwise flush left

### Social Media (Profile Presence)

- Profile photo: consistent across platforms. Warm tones preferred; avoid stark white backgrounds in photo.
- Bio/About: write in full sentences, not bullet points. No hashtags in bio.
- Handle: `@elliotreich` or closest available — consistency across platforms over creativity.
- Header images: Parchment background with name in DM Sans, or a photograph with warm tones. No stock imagery.

### Business Cards (if used)

- Stock: heavyweight, uncoated warm white (not bright white)
- Front: ELLIOT REICH, flush left, large. Nothing else.
- Back: contact info in Inter Regular, small. Bark or printed in a warm dark ink.
- Consider letterpress or flat printing — no gloss laminate.

## 06 — Photography & Imagery

- Favor warm, natural light. Film-adjacent tones over heavily processed looks.
- Architecture, urban infrastructure, printed matter, interiors — all appropriate subject matter.
- No stock photography. If illustration is needed, favor line-based or architectural drawing styles.
- Image treatments: slightly desaturated, warm shadows. Never cool or blue-shifted.

---

## 07 — Voice & Tone

Though this guide is primarily visual, the written voice is part of the identity.

- **Precise, not terse.** Say exactly what needs to be said. Not a word less, not more.
- **Curious, not performative.** Intellectual engagement that doesn't announce itself.
- **No hedging.** Avoid "sort of," "kind of," "I think maybe." Commit to the sentence.
- **First person, active voice** wherever possible.
- **Avoid: "passionate about," "excited to," "thrilled to."** Show, don't announce.

---

## 08 — What This Identity Is Not

Understanding the edges is as important as the center.

- Not playful or irreverent — warmth comes from precision, not personality performance
- Not corporate — no hard blues, no sans-serif grids without warmth
- Not maximalist — restraint is the aesthetic, not a limitation
- Not cold-minimal — the palette always runs warm
